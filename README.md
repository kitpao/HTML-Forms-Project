As Microverse students we intend to recreate as good as possible the Mint's sign up page, requesting all the required data to the user and save for further processing.

This project is made by Kitzia Vidal and Leonardo Mezu

Skills to use and requirements:

Use forms to fill the required data from the user, this is:

sign up: email.

sign up: phone-number.

sign up: password.

Specifying the type of data required

Submit and send info button, and also add a sign in button at the upper right corner.

Add icons where needed.

For last all the forms must be in a box at the whole center of the page.
